# CVE-2021-28460

## Domain knowledge

azure sphere: microsoft’s iot platform using a hardened linux kernel and custom drivers for secure device management. userland apps communicate with kernelspace via IOCTLs (input/output control calls).

ioctl: userspace → kernelspace interface for device-specific commands. each call passes user pointers that the kernel must safely copy in before operating.

copy_from_user: linux helper that copies data from userspace; if part of the region is invalid (page not mapped), it **zero-pads** the remainder and signals an error. unsafe freeing of pointers touched by a failed copy can lead to use-after-free or arbitrary free.
