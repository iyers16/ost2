# Domain: TTY / IOCTL / Process groups

tty: legacy “teletype” device abstraction in Unix; modern systems use pseudo-terminals (PTYs) made of a **master/slave pair** that pass I/O between user programs and the kernel.

ioctl: userspace → kernel system call for device-specific commands; often a big attack surface since it copies attacker-controlled data into kernel structs.

process groups: sets of processes receiving shared signals (like Ctrl-C). each `tty_struct` tracks a pointer to its controlling process group via `pgrp` (a `struct pid *`), protected by a spinlock (`ctrl_lock`).  
reference counting via `get_pid()` (retain) and `put_pid()` (release) ensures the PID struct is freed once no tty/process references it remain.
