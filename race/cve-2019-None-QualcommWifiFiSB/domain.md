# 2019-CVE-None-QualcommWiFiSB

## Domain knowledge

qualcomm socs: the main “application processor” (AP) runs android/linux, while peripherals like the modem and wifi run their own firmware on separate cores. the AP loads those firmwares into shared RAM via the “Peripheral Image Loader” (PIL) before resetting the peripheral CPUs.

mba (modem boot authenticator): small verified firmware the modem ROM runs first; its job is to authenticate and load later firmware chunks (modem.b00, modem.b01, etc). the AP initially writes all of them into shared memory and triggers the modem CPU reset.

trustzone: arm security extension meant to isolate secure and nonsecure regions, but only works if the AP sets it up. if the AP is compromised, it can disable those protections — especially since both AP and modem share physical RAM regions for firmware loading.
