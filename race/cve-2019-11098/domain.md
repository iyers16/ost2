# CVE-2019-11098

## Domain knowledge

uefi boot chain: intel’s boot flow starts from the CPU verifying an *authenticated code module (ACM)* in SPI flash. that ACM verifies the *security (SEC)* and *pre-efi initialization (PEI)* phases, which then load the *driver execution environment (DXE)* and *boot device select (BDS)* stages. each phase verifies the next, forming a “chain of trust.”

spi flash: nonvolatile storage on the motherboard holding uefi firmware (ACM, PEI/DXE code, nv vars). when the CPU starts, it executes code fetched directly from this chip — often in “cache-as-RAM” before DRAM is online.

bootguard: intel mechanism that enforces signature verification of firmware components, relying on SPI reads for integrity checks before execution. but if firmware is fetched twice, those reads can become a TOCTOU window.
