# CVE-2020-11901

No size checks seem to be made for resourceRecordAfterNamePtr. If an attacker were to make it arbitrarily large we would for sure run into an integer overflow in no time.

However looking at the second function this seems more pertinent that we are counting across 16 bits in a loop. It seems to me if this were to wrap around and supply a really small number as return value, then we'd be allocating a very small buffer on the heap, which is prone to heap buffer overflow.
