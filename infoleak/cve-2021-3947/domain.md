## QEMU NVMe Virtual Controller (Domain)

QEMU emulates an **NVMe controller** as part of its virtual hardware stack.  
In a VM, the guest OS communicates with this virtual NVMe device just as it would with real hardware, using PCIe commands and DMA buffers.  
Inside QEMU, these commands are handled by functions like `nvme_changed_nslist()` and `nvme_tx()`, which prepare data and transfer it between guest memory and QEMU’s process memory.

Because this entire stack runs in the QEMU host process, any arithmetic or bounds mistakes that lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes can leak host memory or corrupt the QEMU process — effectively breaching isolation between the guest and host.  
In this case, a guest with kernel privileges can send a crafted NVMe command that tricks the virtual controller into reading arbitrary host memory and returning it to the guest, leading to an **information disclosure** vulnerability.
