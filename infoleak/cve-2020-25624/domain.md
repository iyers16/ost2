## QEMU OHCI USB Controller (Domain)

QEMU’s emulated **Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI)** implements the USB 1.1 host controller logic in software, handling packet scheduling and DMA transfers between virtual devices and the guest OS.  
Because QEMU’s OHCI controller must interpret memory structures sent by the **guest kernel driver** (endpoint and transfer descriptors), it effectively exposes a hardware-like interface that trusts the guest to provide valid addresses and lengths.  
In a compromised guest scenario, those structures are attacker-controlled, turning QEMU’s OHCI parsing logic into a potential escape surface.  
Here, the vulnerable path lies in the handling of *isochronous transfer descriptors (iso TDs)* — variable-length USB packet descriptors that define data regions for time-sensitive transfers.
