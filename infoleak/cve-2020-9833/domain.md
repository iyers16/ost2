## Apple Broadcom WLAN v2 Kernel Extension (Domain)

Apple’s Wi-Fi subsystem is implemented through the `IO80211Family` driver families — version 1 and version 2 (`IO80211FamilyV2`), each handling Broadcom NICs (`AppleBCMWLANBusInterfacePCIe`, etc.).  
These kexts bridge userspace Wi-Fi frameworks to Broadcom chip firmware, managing firmware loading, traps, and crash handling.  
The driver allocates and maintains kernel buffers (trap info structures) that are later copied back to userspace for diagnostics.  
Because this hand-off crosses a privilege boundary, any uninitialized or race-corrupted data in these buffers risks leaking kernel memory contents directly into userspace.
