# CVE-2020-10005

the ACID data here to follow is primarily packet_input_ptr, when that goes into the extract function its copied over to the buf field in memcpy_src.

The real danger is near the stubs::memcpy of wcSharePath from memcpy_src since we can literally supply any data as well as any size due to packet_size and num_chars, so it becomes a classic SBO over the fixed size of wcSharePath.
