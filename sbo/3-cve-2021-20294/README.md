# CVE-2021-20294

Already there is a clear sense that we should be following the ACID flow starting from Filedata *filedata.

after a couple of checks and prints of the filedata, we enter an if statement with a sprintf. sprintf is usually a weak function for SBO so looking at it it looks like the version string that we extract from filedata, will be copied over into a fixed size buffer, this is classic SBO as we can write in data at the correct offset in filedata that will be picked up by the version string getter and will be promptly place in the fixed buffer without any size checking.

Additionally we dont seem to be advancing the buffer after this write so it seems like we just keep overwriting the same memory again and again.
