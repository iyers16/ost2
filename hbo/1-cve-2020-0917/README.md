# CVE-2020-0917

I honestly had no clue what I was looking at when I first saw this snippet of code. NT code definitely does not look like Linux kernel code.

I had to watch the solution video to guide me through it however I don't think I fully have grasped the concepts in it due to the NT-specific operations that I'm not completely familiar with.
