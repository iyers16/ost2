# CVE-2020-1020

g_font->numMasters is our ACID entry, let me follow the data it taints.

first it appears to be the count to iterate up unto in the first for-loop (already a bad sign that ACID data be given this much control over undoubtedly address pointer arithmetic).

before i go any further into diving into what GetOpenFixedArray could possibly mean something caught my eye. 

ptrs and values have each a size limit of 2 however the last for loop near the end seems to be ACID controlled, the limit being g_font->numMasters. As the hint says, this can go as high as 16, so this looks like a perfect example of being able to access and write data in places we're not supposed to.
